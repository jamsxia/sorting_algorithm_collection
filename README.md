# sorting_algorithm_collection
When I studied algorithm, I was confused about which algorithm can be particualry suiable in which situation. Thus, in order to have a clear understanding of sorting algorithm, I will upload five types of algorithm here, including : quick_sort, merge_sort, selection_sort, bubble_sort, insertion_sort. Plus, I will make word explanation here in Readme.

All files are written in c++. If you are the guy who only stick to leetcode, there is some necessary tricks in writing real cpluplus file.
